# Programming Assignment 3: Collinear Points

## Objective
Identify all line segments connecting 4 or more collinear points from a given set in the plane.

## Tasks
1. **Point API**: Implement `compareTo`, `slopeTo`, and `slopeOrder` methods.
2. **BruteCollinearPoints.java**: Find all line segments containing 4 points using brute force.
3. **FastCollinearPoints.java**: Use sorting to identify collinear points efficiently.

## Performance
- Brute force: \(O(n^4)\) time.
- Fast solution: \(O(n^2 \log n)\) time.
