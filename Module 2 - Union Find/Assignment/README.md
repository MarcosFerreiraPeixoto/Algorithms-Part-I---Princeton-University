# Programming Assignment 2: Queues

## Objective
Implement a **Deque** and a **RandomizedQueue** using arrays and linked lists. This assignment will teach the use of generics, iterators, and the implementation of basic data structures.

## Deque API
- Implement methods to add and remove items from both ends.
- Handle exceptions like `IllegalArgumentException`, `NoSuchElementException`, and `UnsupportedOperationException`.
- Must support constant-time operations.

## RandomizedQueue API
- A queue where items are removed randomly.
- Operations should be constant amortized time.
- Implement independent iterators with random order.

## Client Program
- Write `Permutation.java` to randomly select `k` items from input.
- Must run in linear time and use constant memory.

## Performance
- Deque/RandomizedQueue: Constant-time operations.
- Permutation: Linear time with minimal memory.
